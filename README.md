# Alternate-Java-version
Alternate version of Java by script BAT

This script allows you to change the version of Java without reinstalling everything.

I strongly advise you to copy paste the already existing environment variables and replace them with those I have proposed.

To change the version, just target the bin folder of your Java version.

.bat is the extension for an MS-DOS batch file. Creating such a file makes it possible to design scripts which will be interpreted by the "shell" or command interpreter in order to execute .EXE or .COM files in particular. This extension is mainly used on Microsoft operating systems.
